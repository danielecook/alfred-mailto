A few bits and bobs to help with development.

- [Client Formats.md](Client Formats.md) describes the formatting
  rules required by various clients.
- [publish-docs.sh](publish-docs.sh) is a thin wrapper around
  [ghp-import][ghp-import]
- [test_client.py](test_client.py) is a script to help determine which
  format an email client accepts.
- [roundcube.js](roundcube.js) is a script for a [Fluid][fluidapp]
  single-session browser and a [Roundcube][roundcube] installation.
