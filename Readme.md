Alfred-MailTo
=============

A Workflow for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/).

![](img/screenshot-2.png)

Quickly select recipients from your Mac's Contacts database and send them to your email client of choice. Also works with Groups/Distribution Lists.

## Usage ##

- `@ <query>` — Search your Contacts by name, nickname, email address. The
  search is fairly smart and will match "bs" to "Bob Smith". You can also enter
  email addresses that aren't in your Contacts.
  - `⇥` — Add selected contact to list of recipients.
  - `↩` or `⌘+NUM` — Add selected contact to list of recipients and send to
    your email client.
- `mailto [<query>]` — Show and edit configuration.

Open Alfred, type `@` or `mailto` (the default keyword) then either hit `ENTER` to open an entirely blank message or start typing the name or email address you'd like to send a mail to.

Addresses will be suggested from matching contacts and groups in your Mac address book. Hit `TAB` to autocomplete the recipient list from the selected result, or `ENTER` or `⌘+NUM` to add the address and start composing a mail.

You can add multiple recipients by adding a comma between them.

Use `mailtoconf` to view/change settings.

## Supported applications ##

In *theory*, any email client should work, as **MailTo** uses the `mailto:` protocol to call your email client.

If your chosen client doesn't work properly with **MailTo**, post a bug report, and I can possibly add formatting rules for that client.

The following email clients currently work "out of the box":

* Apple Mail
* Sparrow
* Thunderbird
* Postbox
* Airmail
* Unibox
* MailMate
* Mailbox (Beta)
* Google Chrome (if you've [set a handler](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1382847?hl=en))

The following do **not** work:

* Safari (it will open your system default mail client instead)

If your email weapon-of-choice isn't working properly, you can try using email addresses only (use `mailtohelp` in Alfred), and file a bug report, too. Perhaps we can get it to work.
