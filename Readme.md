Alfred-MailTo
=============

![](img/screenshot-2.png)

A Workflow for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/) that allows you to choose from your Mac Contacts, including Groups (or enter email addresses manually) and compose a message using the email app of your choice.

Uses the [alfred-python](https://github.com/nikipore/alfred-python) library by [nikipore](https://github.com/nikipore).

## Usage ##

Open Alfred, type `mailto` (the default keyword) then either hit `ENTER` to open an entirely blank message or start typing the name or email address you'd like to send a mail to.

Addresses will be suggested from matching contacts and groups in your Mac address book. Hit `TAB` to autocomplete the recipient list from the selected result, or `ENTER` or `âŒ˜+NUM` to add the address and start composing a mail.

You can add multiple recipients by adding a comma between them.

## Copyright etc. ##
