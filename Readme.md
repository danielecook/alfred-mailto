Alfred-MailTo
=============

![](img/screenshot-2.png)

A Workflow for [Alfred 2](http://www.alfredapp.com/) that allows you to choose recipients from your Mac Contacts, including Groups (or enter email addresses manually) and compose a message using the email app of your choice.

Uses the [alfred-python](https://github.com/nikipore/alfred-python) library by [nikipore](https://github.com/nikipore) and [docopt](http://docopt.org/).

## Usage ##

Open Alfred, type `mailto` (the default keyword) then either hit `ENTER` to open an entirely blank message or start typing the name or email address you'd like to send a mail to.

Addresses will be suggested from matching contacts and groups in your Mac address book. Hit `TAB` to autocomplete the recipient list from the selected result, or `ENTER` or `âŒ˜+NUM` to add the address and start composing a mail.

You can add multiple recipients by adding a comma between them.

Use `mailtoconf` to view/change settings.

## Supported applications ##

**MailTo** uses the `mailto:` protocol and as such should work with pretty much any email client.

The following apps definitely work:

* Mail.app
* Sparrow
* MailMate
* Unibox
* Airmail
* Thunderbird
* Google Chrome (if you've [set a handler](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/1382847?hl=en))

The following do **not** work:

* Safari (it will open your default mail client instead)
