Alfred-MailTo
=============

A Workflow for [Alfred 2][alfred].

Quickly select recipients from your Mac's Contacts database and send them to
your email client of choice. Also works with Groups/Distribution Lists.

## Download and installation ##

You can install MailTo either from [GitHub releases][github-releases] or
[the Packal website][packal-page].

Install by double-clicking `MailTo.alfredworkflow`.


## Usage ##

**Note:** The first time you run MailTo, you will probably be asked to grant
access to your Contacts. Obviously enough, if you refuse access, MailTo won't
work.

Use the `@` keyword in Alfred to access MailTo and search your Mac's Address
Book.

Recipients will be suggested from matching contacts and groups in the
accounts configured in your `Contacts` app (see the [help][help] file for
supported account types).

Hit `⇥` to autocomplete the recipient list from the selected result, or `↩`
or `⌘+NUM` to add the address to the recipient list and start composing a mail.

You can add multiple recipients by adding a comma between them.

Use `mailto` to view/change settings.

See [Help][help] for more information.
